------
Notes:
------
1) For emulator to work without the F5, need to set DNS preferred 8.8.8.8 and alternate 8.8.4.4
   - doesn't seem to matter when F5 is running.

-------
Design:
-------
-> Swipe to delete with Ok/Cancel.

-> Notification of those Races nearing race time.

-> Summary view:
   - Past race time - red       (> race time).
   - Nearing race time - orange (within race time - 3 min).
   - Before race time - green   (< race time - 3 min) <<-- default, all text is initially green.

Notification algorithm:
-----------------------
Alarm receiver has access to Summary cache/table via view holder.

For each item in summary view:
  - is elapsed flag already set ?
    - false
      - compare race time to current time
        - is race time > current time ?
          - true
            - set text to Red
            - set elapsed flag true
            - loop to next item
        - is race time >= (current time - 3 min) and <= current time ?
          - is notification flag already set ?
            - false
              - set text to orange
              - set notification flag
              - trigger notification
              - loop to next item
        - is race time < (current time - 3 min)
          - true
            - do we care about this condition ?

-------
Issues:
-------
-> Tap on a notification, navigate to SummaryFragment:
   - multiples of the same item display.

-> Last item in recyclerview doesn't always display properly, navigation overlays bottom.

-> If you swipe to delete a Meeting, then any related Summary values should also be deleted.

-------
Others:
-------
-> Table of country/meeting codes, set when Db is created (quasi reference values) ?
   (https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm)

   e.g. CCode    MCode    Description
        AU       BR       Brisbane
        AU       MR       Melbourne
        AU       SR       Sydney
        AU       WR       Perth ?
        AU       AR       Adelaide
        AU       TR       ?
        XX       xx       ?
        XX       xx       ?
        NZ       xx       New Zealand
        HK       xx       Hong Kong
        KR       xx       Korea
        JP       xx       Japan

-> xxx
